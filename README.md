# neuralnet
### Work In Progress
First attempt at a neural network implementation from scratch.
Goal is to train on mnist dataset, and implement a rudementary gui so users can draw/test their own digits.
#### Currently
- Fully working implementation that can achieve a ~93% accuracy
##### Working On
- Save/load model from .txt or .csv file
- GUI interface for user to load existing model or train froms scratch
- After basic GUI is done, implement user drawing/testing own digits
