# neuralnet (Work in Progress)
#### First attempt at a neural network implementation with:
- MNIST dataset for training/testing
- Using only Eigen for Matrix operations and SFML for graphical output
- Add feature for users to draw/test created digits

#### Currently
- Fully working implementation that can achieve a 93% accuracy
#### Working On
- Implementing feature for users to draw their own digit and test against the network
