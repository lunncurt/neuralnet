# neuralnet
### Work In Progress
First attempt at a neural network implementation from scratch.
Goal is to train on mnist dataset, and implement a rudementary gui so users can draw/test their own digits.
#### Currently
- Working on implementing forward pass, having issues with vector assignment in Eigen
- Looking to implement training methods once finished with forward pass
