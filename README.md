# neuralnet
### Work In Progress
First attempt at a neural network implementation from scratch.
Goal is to train on mnist dataset, and implement a rudementary gui so users can draw/test their own digits.
#### Currently
- Working on broad pseudo while gaining a better understanding about training and neuron activation functions.
- Finished experimenting with loading/viewing mnist from .csv in seperate project, implementation coming soon.
